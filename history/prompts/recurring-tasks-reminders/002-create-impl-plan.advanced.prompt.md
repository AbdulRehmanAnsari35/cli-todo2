response_text: "I have successfully created the implementation plan for the Advanced Level features (Recurring Tasks & Time-Based Reminders) of your CLI-based Todo App. The plan includes:\n\n1. Technical Context with language, dependencies, and constraints\n2. Constitution Check ensuring compliance with project principles\n3. Project structure outlining the planned files and directories\n4. Research summary covering key technical decisions\n5. Data model extension plan with enhanced Task object\n6. CLI command contracts defining the extended interfaces\n7. Implementation plan with detailed steps for all requirements\n\nAll artifacts have been created in the specs/003-recurring-tasks-reminders/ directory:\n- plan.md (main implementation plan)\n- research.md (technical research summary)\n- data-model.md (extended data model)\n- quickstart.md (usage guide)\n- contracts/cli-contracts.md (command interface contracts)\n\nThe QWEN.md file has also been updated with context about the current feature."
outcome: "Implementation plan created successfully with all required artifacts"
evaluation: "The plan addresses all requirements from the prompt and is ready for the next phase (generating tasks)"
