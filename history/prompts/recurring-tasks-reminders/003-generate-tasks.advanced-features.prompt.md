response_text: "I have successfully generated the tasks.md file for the Advanced Level features (Recurring Tasks & Time-Based Reminders) of the CLI-based Todo App. The tasks are organized in phases following the user stories from the specification:\n\n1. Phase 1: Setup - Environment preparation\n2. Phase 2: Foundational Tasks - Core model and service extensions\n3. Phase 3: User Story 1 - Create Recurring Tasks (Priority: P1)\n4. Phase 4: User Story 2 - Complete Recurring Tasks (Priority: P1)\n5. Phase 5: User Story 3 - Set Due Dates and Times (Priority: P2)\n6. Phase 6: User Story 4 - Receive Time-Based Reminders (Priority: P2)\n7. Phase 7: User Story 5 - Manage Recurring Task Properties (Priority: P3)\n8. Phase 8: Integration with Existing Features\n9. Phase 9: Edge Case Handling\n10. Phase 10: Testing & Validation\n11. Phase 11: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n\nThe tasks cover all required functionality including data model extensions, CLI command extensions, recurring task logic, reminder checks, integration, edge cases, and testing. Each task follows the required checklist format with IDs, story labels where appropriate, and file paths."
outcome: "Tasks generated successfully with proper organization and coverage of all requirements"
evaluation: "The task list comprehensively covers all required functionality for the Advanced Level features and is organized in a logical sequence that follows the user stories and implementation plan."
